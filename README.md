# Property Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts residential property prices using supervised machine learning techniques. The model is trained on real-world housing data obtained from Kaggle.

## Dataset
House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading
2. Data cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature selection
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation
7. Price prediction

## Results
Random Forest Regressor performed better than Linear Regression based on R² score and error metrics.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset
3. Run all cells sequentially
